  <h1>What Paul and Peter Saw in the Future</h1>
  <p class="intro">A plainspoken reflection for the weary, the teachable, and the cast-out.</p>

  <div class="question">Using Paul's letters to the churches, speculate on what he saw in the future</div>
  <h2>Paul’s Vision (For the Weary Soul)</h2>

  <p><strong>1. People Would Twist the Gospel:</strong> Paul knew some would turn the good news into something heavier—rules, pressure, confusion. But grace never changes. If you’re holding on to Jesus, that’s enough.</p>

  <p><strong>2. A Remnant Would Remain:</strong> Even if churches drift, Paul believed some folks would keep clinging to Christ—quiet, steady, unseen by the world but known by God.</p>

  <p><strong>3. The Church Would Be Bigger Than Expected:</strong> Not just one group or one place. Paul saw Jews and Gentiles together, rich and poor, all adopted into the same family.</p>

  <p><strong>4. There Would Be Spiritual Battle:</strong> He didn’t hide it. Walking with Jesus invites resistance. But Paul gave us armor: truth, faith, salvation. Not to impress, but to endure.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Jesus Is Coming Back:</strong> Paul’s greatest hope? That Jesus would return and set things right. The weary would rise. The faithful would be gathered. The waiting would end.</p>

  <div class="question">Did the Apostle Peter have views on the same topic?</div>
  <h2>Peter’s Vision (For the One Who Feels Left Out)</h2>

  <p><strong>1. Outsiders Would Be Welcomed In:</strong> Peter saw God’s heart through a vision — He was opening the door wide. The gospel was for anyone with faith.</p>

  <p><strong>2. The Spirit Moves Freely:</strong> When Gentiles received the Spirit, Peter knew God didn’t wait for “clean” credentials. Just open hearts.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Suffering Would Be Part of the Story:</strong> Peter said don’t be surprised by trials — they refine you, not reject you.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Believers Are Living Stones:</strong> Not a temple with walls — but a spiritual house built with lives, even the cracked ones.</p>

  <p><strong>5. The Return of Jesus Means Justice:</strong> Peter’s hope was the same: a new heaven, a new earth, a place where righteousness finally feels like home.</p>
