  <h1>What Paul and Peter Saw in the Future</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="question">Using Paul's letters to the churches, speculate on what he saw in the future</div>
    <h2>Paul’s Vision (For the Weary and Teachable)</h2>

    <p><strong>1. People Would Twist the Gospel:</strong> Paul warned not everyone would stick to the truth. Some would burden others with rules or confusion. He urged believers to hold tight to grace alone.</p>

    <p><strong>2. A Remnant Would Remain:</strong> Even if things got messy, some would still love Jesus deeply—quietly walking in faith while others drifted.</p>

    <p><strong>3. The Church Would Cross Borders:</strong> He saw a global body—different races, classes, and cultures knit together as one family in Christ.</p>

    <p><strong>4. A Spiritual Struggle Would Unfold:</strong> There’d be opposition—not just social, but spiritual. He urged believers to stand firm, armored not in pride but in truth, faith, and grace.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Jesus Will Return:</strong> Paul kept his eyes on the horizon. Christ's return wasn’t a fear tactic—it was a promise of restoration and reunion.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="question">Did the Apostle Peter have views on the same topic?</div>
    <h2>Peter’s Vision (For the One Who Feels Left Out)</h2>

    <p><strong>1. The Family Would Get Bigger:</strong> Peter saw walls come down. His vision at Joppa revealed that God was welcoming people far outside the expected religious mold.</p>

    <p><strong>2. The Spirit Moves Freely:</strong> When Gentiles received the Spirit, Peter knew God didn’t wait for “clean” credentials. He responds to hearts open in faith.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Suffering Would Come:</strong> Peter didn’t paint it rosy. He knew fire would come, but he called it refining—not rejection.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Every Believer Was a Living Stone:</strong> Whether cracked or polished, each believer had a place in God's spiritual house.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Jesus Is Coming to Make Things Right:</strong> Peter joined Paul in looking forward. Justice, righteousness, and hope are coming—and we’re invited in.</p>
